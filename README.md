## Instructions

<https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/apprenticeship/client-side-app/project/>
The goal is to build an interactive game-like thing that uses data from an API.

## Criteria

- [ ] Accept some user input (e.g. a username)
- [ ] Query an API (e.g. the Github API, or any other fun one)
- [ ] Populate the UI with API data
- [ ] Have some form of persistent state and interactivity, e.g.
- [ ] A hunger bar that decreases over time and is topped up when you feed them stars
- [ ] A button to add more users to your collection

## Stretch criteria

- [ ] Save your state to localstorage so you can leave the page and come back later
- [ ] Make it look great

## Set up

- [x] Vite
- [x] ESLint, Prettier
- [x] Netlify deployment
- [ ] ? API secrets
